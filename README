DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to use the name spinner and whois search
    available on domaintools.com.

    These methods are available as both class and object methods. Nothing is
    exported by default.

EXPORTS
    None by default.

    Allowed:

     - search_engine
     - name_spinner

METHODS
    search_engine ( url parameters hash )
        The keys and values expected are documented on the Domain Tools
        website. In addition the "search engine" specific parameters, you
        need to pass the required parameters as documented in the
        WWW::DomainTools::SearchEngine new() method.

        If the request is successful, the return value is either a hash
        reference or a string depending on the value of the 'format'
        parameter to the constructor.

        See the documentation for the new() method for more detailed
        information about 'format' and other standard parameters.

        If the HTTP request fails, this method will die.
